\section{Dataset of choice}\label{dataset-of-choice}}

For this project I decided to pick a custom-built dataset obtained from
the \href{https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx}{World bank
Databank}, specifically the
\href{https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators}{World
Development Indicators database}. This is the ``primary World Bank
collection of development indicators'' as stated on the database
description. It has lots of economic, education, energy use, and
population specific metrics.

I find demographic data fascinating, and I think this dataset will be
quite good for predicting country development measures along with
providing quite interesting and relevant information.

\newpage

\hypertarget{the-target-variable}{%
\subsubsection{The target variable}\label{the-target-variable}}

As all these variables could perhaps tell us how developed a country is,
we used a constructed categorized Human development index variable in
order to classify the countries using the above variables (unless stated
otherwise by their colour) as training variables.

The criteria for constructing the categorical variable \emph{hdi\_cat}
was the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Very high: HDI above 0.8
    \item High: HDI between 0.7 and 0.799
    \item Medium: HDI between 0.55 and 0.699
    \item Low: HDI under 0.55
  \end{itemize}

This categorization is emulated from Wikipedia's construction and uses
the same ranges as used in every Wikipedia article referencing HDI.

\hypertarget{data-preprocessing}{%
\section{Data preprocessing}\label{data-preprocessing}}

The data cleanup and preliminary feature engineering was done in Python
and the imputation was then done in R within the same Jupyter Notebook
(called \emph{preprocessing.ipynb}).

\hypertarget{methodology-and-steps}{%
\subsection{Methodology and steps}\label{methodology-and-steps}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prior to importing there was a search within the .csv file with the following regex: \begin{verbatim} \s\[[\w\S]{1,}\] \end{verbatim} as a find and replace and removing every instance of it. This regex matches a metadata tag that the world bank uses in their dataset. Following this step, the data was imported.

  \item Metadata at the end of the dataset was removed, the dataset was filtered excluding these region codes (the codes were excluded as they were country aggregates, and we're only interested in the countries themselves).

  \item The year column was converted to integer and the '..' values (which represent NAs in the World bank databank) were replaced for numpy NaNs and then the values were sorted by year and country name.

  \item Data missing in later years (2020, 2019) was backfilled with data from previous years, as it still fits our modelling purposes. The data that goes the furthest back is from ~18 years prior, so 2002.

  \item Columns with more than 45 NA values were removed as this represents roughly 25% of the countries in question.

  \item The life expectancy, GDP, GNI and fertility rate columns were removed as these are either components of HDI or (in the case of fertility rate) are 100% correlated with other elements in our dataset (crude birth rate in this particular case).

  \item We scrape Wikipedia in order to obtain an updated metric on HDI estimates for each country. We also scrape it to obtain the alpha-3 3166 codes for each country. The data was obtained with the purpose of making it easier to join with the dataset obtained from the World Bank, as joining by country names is not reliable enough (misses ~20 countries which the alpha-3 codes do not).

  \item We add HDI to the main dataframe

  \item Numerical columns were converted into floats and column names were simplified for easier future manipulation.

  \item The categorical target variable is constructed as explained previously in this step.

  \item The data is then exported as a csv, along with a json file that shows how the columns were renamed

  \item The data is then imported in an R cell and a MICE imputation is performed using the 'cart' method with m = 5 in order to impute the very few missing values remaining.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

\hypertarget{looking-at-variables-by-themselves}{%
\subsection{Looking at variables by
themselves}\label{looking-at-variables-by-themselves}}

The plots of choice for visually analyzing the variables prior to any
processing has been Boxplots and Histograms/density plots all looked at
individually and categorized by \emph{hdi\_cat} which is our categorical
target variable (HDI).

Given the space constraints of this report, if a plot for a specific
variable is not shown here but talked about or mentioned, it will be
shown in the \emph{eda.ipynb} and \emph{eda.html} notebook and notebook
export used to perform the visual analysis. Only variables which are
used in the modelling section will be visually analyzed and described.

\hypertarget{significantly-right-skewed-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Significantly right-skewed
variables}\label{significantly-right-skewed-variables}}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,height=\textheight]{./img/foreign_inv_inflows.png}
\caption{Foreign Investment Inflows}
\end{figure}

The following variables showed a similarly right-skewed shape with
significant outliers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{foreign\_inv\_inflows}: Heavily right skewed, significant
  outliers (USA, UK, Germany, China\ldots{}) etc\ldots{} Given the
  histogram of \emph{foreign\_inv\_inflows} when grouped by very high
  HDI vs low HDI, it would seem like the more developed a country is,
  the more foreign investment it should have. The grouped boxplot also
  shows the same trend.
\item
  \textbf{int\_tourism\_receipts} and \textbf{int\_tourism\_arrivals}:
  Basically the same as with \emph{foreign\_inv\_inflows}, we see that
  there's a significant tendency for higher development nations to
  receive significantly more tourism receipts and arrivals.
\item
  \textbf{greenhouse\_gas\_em}: Just like with the previous two
  variables, fossil fuel use, meat production and economic activities
  like such produce huge amounts of greenhouse gases, and the more
  developed a country is, the more emissions it produces. However, this
  one is a bit less strongly inclined like the previous two. We can
  clearly see that there's many less developed countries with a high
  level of emissions. A notorious example of this is China, which is the
  2nd country with the most emissions and falls under the high category
  of HDI, by far exceeding the emission levels of most countries with
  very high HDI countries.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{education-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Education variables}\label{education-variables}}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,height=\textheight]{./img/education_years.png}
\caption{Years of compulsory education}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{education\_years}: There's a clear tendency, both shown by our
  grouped boxplots and grouped density plots, for very high HDI
  countries to have significantly longer periods compulsory education,
  with few exceptions in each group, however a clear tendency that peaks
  between 8 and 12 years of education for both high and very high HDI
  countries. Low and medium HDI countries could be clumped together with
  similar compulsory education times, but with more variability for
  medium HDI countries.
\item
  \textbf{education\_perc\_gdp}: How much are countries spending on
  education as a percentage of their GDP is a very interesting variable,
  as we can see that the consistency for higher and lower spendings
  respectively for low and very high HDI countries is quite solid, while
  medium HDI countries show an incredible variability versus other
  groups. High HDI countries show significant variability versus that of
  very high and low HDI countries, however, still aligning more iwth
  very high HDI countries than the rest.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{other-economic-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Other economic
variables}\label{other-economic-variables}}

These variables might have some skewness towards more tails or longer
tails than a normally distributed variable should have. Therefore
they're hard to classify as particularly right or left skewed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{exports\_perc\_gdp}: This variable has a long left tail and it
  is right-skewed. We can see the box for medium developed countries is
  larger than others while very high and high HDI countries tend to have
  higher export amounts as percentage of GDP. Low HDI countries lag
  behind, as expected. It is interesting to see how medium HDI countries
  completely bridge the gaps between high, very high and low HDI
  countries in terms of exports, in the sense that there's plenty of
  countries with medium HDI with exports just as high as others with
  significantly higher HDIs.
\item
  \textbf{inflation\_perc}: For inflation we can see that independently
  of the HDI of a country, inflation could, perhaps, be an inevitable
  event of economic/political management or mismanagement and
  uncertainty. Either way, we can clearly see that the higher the HDI,
  the less uncertain such inflation rate will be. The boxes for medium
  and low HDI countries are significantly larger than very high and high
  therefore telling us that there's less consistency and high inflation
  events, while universal, are unpredictable, but less unpredictable and
  probably less common the higher the HDI of a country is.
\item
  \textbf{gds\_perc\_gdp}: For gross domestic savings we can see that
  there's a clear difference between groups, with much more overlapping
  on the high end of HDI than the medium to low end of HDI. However,
  clearly, once again, the higher the HDI the higher the GDS. Much more
  variability again on those middle HDI groups (high and medium).
\item
  \textbf{gross\_savings\_perc\_gdp}: Gross savings as a percentage of
  GDP is an interesting variable, where the only defining feature of
  high and very high HDI countries being, again, relative consistency
  versus other groups, there might be seemingly no predictive capability
  in it due to the extremely lo variability of the values among groupsm
  however, it definitely differentiates very high and low HDI countries
  quite well.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{other-interesting-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Other interesting
variables}\label{other-interesting-variables}}

These variables seemed like quite appropriate to me for predicting HDI
or any other development measure, as they could potentially be huge
differentiators between the different HDI groups.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,height=\textheight]{./img/access_to_electricity.png}
\caption{Percentage of population with access to electricity}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{perc\_internet\_users}: The percentage of internet users in
  each group is a surprisingly good differentiator as mentioned
  previously. We can see that, sure there's countries in each group with
  percentages that resemble other groups, but the difference in
  variability among groups is massive. Where the consistency of low HDI
  countries vs very high and high HDI countries is significantly
  different. We can see the standard deviations (and means) per group
  follow an interesting ladder: \(\sigma_{low} \approx 0.714\),
  \(\sigma_{medium} \approx 2.532\), \(\sigma_{high} \approx 4.908\),
  \(\sigma_{very\_high} \approx 20.382\).
\item
  \textbf{access\_to\_electricity}: another Hugely differentiating
  variable with similar properties to \emph{perc\_internet\_users}. We
  can see a clear division where if the country is in the very high HDI
  category, it will almost certainly have near full coverage in its
  electricity supply to its population. Countries in the high category
  are also clearly differentiated with the rest while also maintaining
  quite high rates. Medium HDI countries show a huge variability in
  their coverage, lower than high HDI countries but higher than low HDI
  countries. Low HDI countries show a significantly lower but clearly
  divided coverage with medium HDI countries.
\item
  \textbf{agricultural\_land}: Agricultural land is an interesting
  variable that might not contribute a great deal to classifying,
  however, it is interesting to visualize how lower HDI countries tend
  to have a significantly higher percentage of agricultural land.
  However the rest of the variables all hover around the same values.
\item
  \textbf{birth\_rate}: Birth rate is a clearly defining variable, where
  we can see the lower HDI countries rise above the rest, along with the
  higher HDI countries jumping way down. Most very high to high HDI
  countries have already experienced a population growth plateau where
  the birth rate goes down significantly and usually either stays
  between 0 and 15 or very slightly above it (as it is necessary for
  demographic sustainability).
\item
  \textbf{gne}: Gross national expenditure shows slightly lower values
  for very high HDI countries than the rest of groups, with higher
  variability for high HDI countries and low to medium HDI countries
  slightly higher. The general histogram for this value shows a long
  left tail with a normal-like distribution.
\item
  \textbf{mobile\_subscriptions}: An amazingly interesting variable with
  very similar properties to that of access to electricity and
  percentage of internet users. We see a very clear spread where the HDI
  groups are very clearly separated with very high HDI having an
  incredibly high variability while still being significantly higher
  than the rest of groups and the high HDI group lagging surprisingly
  behind but still a lot higher than low and medium HDI countries. The
  variable is quite right-skewed with most of the countries clumping
  around the low-medium area as there isn't an incredibly large
  difference between low and medium HDI countries for this one.
  -\textbf{infant\_mort\_rate}: Quite left skewed as both high and very
  high HDI countries have most of their values closer to zero while low
  and medium HDI countries have a much larger spread with low HDI
  countries taking the top position given the poverty conditions. Medium
  HDI countries lag behind low HDI countries while still maintaining a
  really high infant mortality rate in general. The variable also
  clearly defines groups and might be quite good at classifying.
  -\textbf{sex\_ratio}: seemingly somewhat normally distributed with a
  long left tail. However quite surprisingly well defined for very high
  and high HDI countries. The differences between groups are interesting
  to see but maybe not quite as differentiating as other variables under
  this section. -\textbf{urban\_pop\_perc}: Population of people living
  in urban areas is a quite spread out variable as we know the more
  developed a country is, the more its population tends to live in urban
  areas. Urban areas are usually higher income areas and tend to offer
  more opportunities for workers, therefore, highly developed nations,
  as it is clear, tend to have quite good job offerings in urban areas.
  We clearly see the groupings here, very high HDI countries have the
  largest urban populations, while low to medium HDI countries have the
  lowest. Interestingly so, low and medium HDI groups are not as well
  separated.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{correlation-matrix}{%
\subsection{Correlation matrix}\label{correlation-matrix}}

This correlation matrix was constructed by calculating the correlation
coefficient for the variables using \emph{Kendall}, \emph{Spearman} and
\emph{Pearson} correlation coefficients and then imputting the values
into a dataframe where only the highest correlation of the three
calculated is added. This way we are able to really illustrate how
correlated the variables truly are.

The idea came from observing significant differences between correlation
calculated for a few pairs of variables, where the correlation
coefficients nearly doubled when moving from \emph{Pearson} to
\emph{Spearman} correlation coefficients.

\includegraphics[width=0.63\textwidth,height=\textheight]{./img/correl_heatmap.png}
\caption{Correlation heatmap}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

Looking at the correlations we highlight some important details:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{int\_tourism\_receipts} and \textbf{int\_tourism\_arrivals}
  are extremely highly correlated at around \emph{0.9}. These
  consideration will be looked at later on as they may or may not
  provide the model with interesting information when both are included
  in it.
\item
  \textbf{access\_to\_electricity} and \textbf{perc\_internet\_users}
  are quite highly correlated at around \emph{0.82} along with
  \textbf{perc\_internet\_users} and \textbf{mobile\_subscriptions} at
  around \emph{0.87} which also showed very similar trends in the
  individual variable analysis.
\item
  \textbf{perc\_internet\_users} along with
  \textbf{access\_to\_electricity} and \textbf{infant\_mort\_rate}, both
  pairs with \emph{-0.9} and \emph{-0.87} respectively. The higher the
  infant mortality rate, the lower the percentage of internet users and
  people with access to electricity.
\item
  \textbf{infant\_mort\_rate} and \textbf{birth\_rate} at around
  \emph{0.87} which is also quite high.
\end{itemize}

There's plenty of other interesting correlations to look at, however the
general idea is that there's quite high correlation among key variables.
Later on we will see whether this hurts the model in general or not.

When plotting a \emph{pairs} plot (scatter plots) between the variables
when grouped by HDI group, we see that there's a clear distinction
similar to what we could appreciate in the boxplots, there's clear
separation between groups in several of the plots.
